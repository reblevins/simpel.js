Check if router is enabled

If Router enabled {
    - Check for routes directory: load routes
    - No routes directory: load templates
    - Enable listeners, fill route array
    - Check for <routes></routes> and replace with routes div
    - Hand off to main
}

- Load templates/components
- Check for templates/components on page and replace with templates
- Load component data:
  - Is there a route? Use that to load the data
  - Otherwise, proceed as usually getting the data based on the tag name.
